This is my attempt to about kernels and operating systems by building one in Rust for a RISC V target.
I'm cross-referencing a few sources as I do so:
- [Philipp Oppermann's tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
- [Stephen Marz's tutorial](http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html)
- [The RISC V implementation of `xv6`](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv)
